3. **Download the File:** Click on the appropriate download link. Depending on your operating system, this file may be an executable or a compressed archive.

4. **Install the Application:**
   - **Windows Users:** If you downloaded an installer (.exe file), double-click the file to start the installation. Follow the prompts that appear on your screen.
   - **macOS/Linux Users:** If you downloaded a .zip or .tar file, extract the contents to a folder of your choice. Open a terminal, navigate to that folder, and run the command below to install dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Application:** Once installed, locate the application file (usually called `anomaly_detection.py`). Double-click it to run or execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python anomaly_detection.py
   ```

## ✏️ How to Use
- **Loading Data:** You can easily load your transaction or sales data using a CSV file. Make sure your data is formatted correctly. Each row should represent a transaction, with columns for relevant attributes (e.g., amount, date, status).
  
- **Choosing Detection Method:** On the application interface, select the detection method you wish to use (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, or Z-score). 

- **Analyzing Results:** After running the analysis, the application will display results and visualizations. Review these to understand where the anomalies occur.

## 📈 Visualizations
The application provides various visuals to help you interpret the results:

- **Graphs:** These will show trends and highlight anomalies.
- **Charts:** Comparative visuals can help you see how the detected outliers relate to the overall dataset.

## 📊 Example Use Case
Imagine you work in retail and want to identify fraudulent transactions. By using the Anomaly Detection application, you can generate synthetic sales data reflecting your real transactions, introduce fake anomalies, and then apply the detection methods to find which transactions don't fit the norm. This approach allows you to practice and improve your skills in data analysis and machine learning without needing sensitive data.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Installation Issues:** Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. If you encounter problems, reinstall Python and try downloading the application again.
  
- **Running Errors:** Make sure you are in the correct directory in your terminal before running the application. If you see an error, check the Python version and dependencies listed in the requirements file.

- **Data Formatting:** Incorrectly formatted data can lead to errors. Always check that your CSV file has the needed columns and proper formatting.
